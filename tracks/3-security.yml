  - title: "Android Security: An In-depth Analysis of Access Control Policies in Android Firmwares and Linux Kernel."
    description: "What I will be covering? 
                In this talk, I will be talking about the internals of the security of Android operating system from a firmware perspective. I will be presenting how access control mechanisms are designed in this large system and how to find inconsistencies that can lead to zero-day exploits in vendors' firmwares. I will also show that many vendors' apps are vulnerable to various security issues. My talk is all backed up by the official Android documentation and the research that I am doing in my PhD in this field.

                Does the talk include Demo?
                For the moment no because I am still working on a tool to automate the process and I don't think (for the moment) that it will be open source.

                How participants will benefit from your talk?
                Participants will get an idea of how Android run their applications and how it ensures a decent level of security for the user from a low level perspective. In addition, they will get an idea of how to find zero-day vulnerabilities in Android by finding inconsistencies in access control policies."

  - title: Container supply chain security
    description: "In this talk we will explore the concepts of containers security, from build to deployment. We will look at some of the popular tools and cloud products that allow to scan images when they are built, find vulnerabilities and flag them and how can configure you CI/CD pipeline to be as secure as possible."
