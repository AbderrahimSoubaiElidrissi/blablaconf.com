  - title: Building smarter app empowered with Machine Learning
    description: "What if your apps could solve problems, deduce information from pictures and solve complex tasks? In the future, mobile apps will be so much more than a data displaying device. Using AI, apps will be able to answer complex problems at a whole new level!
        In this session, I'll  show you how to get started building apps with Xamarin powered by Machine Learning. and  how you can use services in the cloud, like Azure Cognitive Services, but also how you can use trained models locally on mobile devices using CoreML and Tensorflow."
